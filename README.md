# PMS

Practice management software (PMS) is a category of software that deals with the day-to- day operations of a medical practice.

It is a hypothetical PMS for a small medical centre which uses SQL Server and Visual C#.Net (WPF) as its front end.

This project has 3 modules:
1. Patient management (records new patients and medical history after a patient has been added to the database).
2. Doctors Management (new doctors, nurses and other staff could be added to the system).
3. Appointment Management (Maintain the appointments)
4. Manage Medical Records

## Prerequisites
1. SQL Server 2017 or higher
2. Visual Studio 2017 or higher

## How to run the program

```
1. Install Microsoft SQL Server
2. Run the sample CreateScript.sql found in the solution
3. Run the SampleDataInserts.sql found in the solution
4. Open the project solution

## Notes
This project is my final project submitted when I was taking Certificate in Programming. All data in this project are hypothetical and records entered does not relate to any real person.
